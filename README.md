Create interactive screencasts inside Jupyter Notebook that anybody can play back.

# Jupyter Graffiti

Ever wanted to offer someone using your Jupyter Notebook a hands-on
demo? Now you can, right inside your Notebook. Any text inside a code
cell can be annotated with a tip (a "graffiti") containing any
markdown of your choice, explaining that portion of the code in
whatever detail you want.  You can also attach a recording of all
all activities in your notebook to a graffiti, including:

* Your voice, recorded with your laptop's microphone
* Your mouse cursor and scrolling up and down the notebook
* All editing inside code cells, and all execution of code cells
* Drawing and highlighting with the mouse over sections you think are important

You can save any number of these graffiti recordings in a notebook.
Viewers can play any graffiti back just by hovering over the
annotation. They can pause any recorded playback anywhere, scrub
forward and backward in time, and interact with the notebook during
playback as they normally would. No need to watch a whole recorded
movie and then switch contexts; students can explore right along with
you in the same environment.

Jupyter Graffiti is easy to use, either as a python library or a
docker image with a Jupyter Extension.  At Udacity, Jupyter Notebooks
have the plugin built in.

You don't need any special software other than the plugin and Jupyter
Notebook to create and save Graffitis.
